x + y = 5;
conditions(x,y>=0)
nCr(n+k-1,k-1)
k -> group of integers
n -> number of integers
| 1 1 1 1 1 -> 0+5 = 5
1 | 1 1 1 1 -> 1+4 = 5
1 1 | 1 1 1 -> 2+3 = 5
1 1 1 | 1 1 -> 3+2 = 5
1 1 1 1 | 1 -> 4+1 = 5
1 1 1 1 1 | -> 5+0 = 5
here all  have 2 group.
if I have k group then we find k-1 bars in the group.
and n+k-1 number of place.

x + y + z = 5;
here  k  = 3;
group of integers = 3;
then bar is k-1;
conditions(x,y,z>=1)
nCr(n-1,k-1)
1 | 1 | 1 1 1 -> 1+1+3 = 5
